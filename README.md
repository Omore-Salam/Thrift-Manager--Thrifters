Thrift Manager
Thrifters is planned to be a platform like Cowrywise except that it is meant to run on thrifts contribution. it aims to solve the problem of thrift contributors absconding with their contributing partners' thrifts by automating the process of thrift collection and payment. The platform will operate like the African traditional thrift system, just that it will be better, faster and will return trust into the financial thrift system.
The project still have a long way to go, and a lot of feasibility testing are still going on and this HTML code will still be refactoring unto a Typescript code in the frontend and Java/Node in the backend.
